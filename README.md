# IELTS_AI
This project is an AI-powered IELTS speaking evaluation system that analyzes a userâ€™s spoken responses and predicts a band score based on official IELTS criteria. The system leverages speech-to-text, natural language processing (NLP), and grammar and fluency analysis to provide detailed feedback on user performance.
